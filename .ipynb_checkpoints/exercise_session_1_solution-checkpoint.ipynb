In this space, our non-linear function might be linear and we solve a linear regression problem. Afterwards, we transform our solution back to the original space. Simply put, we are thus able to approximate a non-linear function in our input-space by approximating a linear-function in a higher dimensional space. <br>\n",

    "Make sure to read the Keras docs dealing with the Sequential model (https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/). The sequential model is the most fundamental part of Keras and allows to sequentially connect different layers of a NN. Thereafter, this model can be compiled and trained. All these low-level functionalities have been implemented in Keras. Next, we create a sequential model and add one hidden layer and one output layer. We use a 'sigmoid' activation function for the hidden layer, and a linear activation function for the output layer. In order to have a non-linear regression model, we need at least one non-linear activation function. Since our model only requires one output, our output layer consists of one neuron. We, arbitrarly, decide to have 12 hidden neurons. Furthermore, we are going to use the RMSprop optimizer and a mean squared error. <br>\n",
    "The amount of hidden neurons and the activation function can greatly affect the performance of our model. For now, this model suffices, but make sure to experiment with different NN architectures once you try to solve a more complex regression problem. <br>\n",
