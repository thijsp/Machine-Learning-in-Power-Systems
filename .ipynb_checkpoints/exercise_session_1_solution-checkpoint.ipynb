In this space, our non-linear function might be linear and we solve a linear regression problem. Afterwards, we transform our solution back to the original space.

All these low-level functionalities have been implemented in Keras. Next, we create a sequential model and add one hidden layer and one output layer. We use a 'relu' activation function for the hidden layer, and a linear activation function for the output layer. In order to have a non-linear regression model, we need at least one non-linear activation function. Since our model only requires one output, our output layer consists of one neuron.
